# Chapter 1: Prerequisite

## 0.1.1-0.1.2 Vector Space

### Definition

**Field**: A set of scalar, denoted as $f$.    
**Vector**: An n-element array formed by element from corresponding filed $f$. Denoted as $V$.  
**Vector Space**: A set of vectors which are closed under addition and multiplication operation, and in addition contain a zero vector.  

## 0.1.3 Subspace & Span  

### Definition

**Nontrivial Subspace**: Subspace except $\{0\}$, $V$.  
**Proper Subspace**: Subspace except $V$.  
   
### Generating Subspace

**Def**:   
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The intersection of all subspace of $V$ that contain $S$ is the generating subspace of $V$, denoted as $spanS$. The generating subspace of null vector set $span\{\}={0}$.  
**Prop**:
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;$spanS$ equals to all linear conbinatnion of vectors in $S$.
